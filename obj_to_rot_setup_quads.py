        # EXPLANATION AS TO HOW THE PLOT WORKS USING THE f VALUES IN THE OBJ
        # quad_shape_points holds the point vectors
        # quad_shape_f holds the sequence of enumerated points (in 1=1st ordinal)
        # The sequence of point vectors in quad_shape_f is used to draw all edges
        # to make a face.
        # Since quad_shape_points is a list of point vectors (list of lists),
        # it takes two indices to access each point value. The first, for the vector in
        # order in the list, and the second for the either x, y or z values.
        # To get the correct points to draw the face, we must use quad_shape_f because
        # it has the correct order of points for each face.
        # Thus, to get the correct indices for the first point vector to plot, we use
        # face[0], which tells us which point vector to use in the order of quad_shape_f
        # for plotting vertex 0 to 1
        # For example, to plot vertex 0 to 1
        # face[0] has the start ordinal for vertex 0. Then the second index is the [0]
        # to get the x value (eg. [1] is the y value, [2] is the z value).

        # plt.plot needs two values, one for x and one for y in this format [x,y]
        # The first point x val is:
        # quad_shape_points[  face[0] ] [0]
        # The first point y val is:
        # quad_shape_points[ face[1]] [0]
